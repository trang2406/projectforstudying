# projectforstudying
This is just simply my own created stupid project for studying. 
I just finished my ISTQB exam last weekend so I need something new to start learning.   
Today is very my first day to acquaint with GIT. 
Many people said that it's not too difficult but for sure it is not easy for me.
By the way, I will try my best as I did before. Hopes it work.
